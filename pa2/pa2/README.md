# This Project consist of program for GRAPH ADT and Find shortest path.
# In this project we also write the GraohTest program for test GRAPH ADT

# Graph.c 
In Graph.c file we create the GRAPH ADT. The Graph ADT consist of creating Graph, initialise abd delete operation on edge and  also Breadth First Search operation on Graph. 

# Graph.h 
In Graph.h file, we create header file for Graph ADT that can used to access the GRAPH ADT from different program.

# GraphTest.c
In GraphTest.c, we create the GraphTest Program for testing Graph ADT.

# FindPath.c
In FindPath.c file, we create to find shortest path from source to destation.

# Makefile
Make File Consist of header details that consist of my academic personal detail. In makefile we write few commands to run FindPath apllication and valgrind use to show memory perfomance detail. For FindPath we need two arguments that is input and ouput file.
