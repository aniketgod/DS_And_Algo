# This project is consist of program for LIST ADT(Abstract Data Types), sparse Matrix ADT.
# In this project we also write the ListTest program and MatrixTest.c for test LIST ADT and Matrix ADT.

# List.c
In List.c file we create the LIST ADT with generic pointer type. The List ADT consist of create, initialise, manipulate and delete operation on list. 

# List.h
In List.h file, we create header file for list that can used to access the LIST ADT for different program.   

# ListTest.c
In ListClient.c, we create the ListTest program for test list ADT by doing some operation.

# Matrix.c
In Matrix.c file we create the Matrix ADT with help of List ADT . The Matrix ADT consist of create, initialise, manipulate (such as addition, subtraction , scalar multiplication, product, transpose) operation on list.

# Matrix.h
In Matrix.h,  we create header file for list that can used to access the LIST ADT for different program. 

# MatrixTest.c
In MatrixTest.c, we create the MatrixTest program for test Matrix ADT by doing some operation.

# sparse.c 
In Sparse.c program, we create the Sparse.c program to perform operation on sparse matrix such as addition, subtraction , scalar multiplication, product, transpose.

# Makefile
In Makefile program, we added gcc command and valgrind command for run the program.
for Sparse we need two command line argument such as input and outputfile name
